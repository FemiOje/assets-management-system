1. Fork the repo.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a branch for the particular issue you are working on( e.g, "2-landing-page").
4. Checkout to your branch and continue working on your issue.
5. When you're done with the issue, create a pull request. 

IMPORTANT: 
- Always pull the latest changes from upstream/main into your forked repo:
  BEFORE YOU START, 
  AND BEFORE YOU CREATE YOUR PULL REQUEST.
(This is to make sure that everybody is working from the same source/checkpoint, as that's where everybody's changes will be merged)
